# Me

I'm Sitryk, a nerd, nothing else to say here so lets get to the cog explanations.

# Cogs <sup><supb><sup>[Here](github.com/Sitryk/sitcogsv3)</sup></sup></sup>

### Lyrics

The lyrics cog lets you search the [Genius](genius) API for songs, you can input the title of a song, the name of an artist or the lyrics to a song that you don't know the name of
> Never gonna give you up
> Never gonna let you down
> Never gonna turn around and forget you.

Using the **genius** command also allows you to flip through pages showing you the album art, page views and some other information, using reactions you can also queue the song in the audio cog if you have it loaded and you can request the lyrics

##### Planned Features

AutoLyrics integrated with the audio cog to send lyrics to a set channel every time the song changes

### VoiceKick

The Discord UI doesn't let you kick members from voice channels, maybe someone fell asleep in a voice channel and you can hear them snoring, (has happened to me before.)

### Utilities
